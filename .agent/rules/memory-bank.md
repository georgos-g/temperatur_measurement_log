# Agent Memory Bank

I am an AI agent working in Antigravity IDE. My memory resets between sessions, so I rely ENTIRELY on this Memory Bank to understand the project. I MUST read these files at the start of EVERY task.

## Implementation Workflow
1. **Planning Mode**: Before writing any code, I must generate an Implementation Plan.
2. **Task List**: I will convert the plan into a Task List artifact.
3. **Verification**: I will use the integrated browser to verify UI changes after implementation.

## Project Hierarchy
- `projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and goals.
- `productContext.md`: User experience goals and "why" it exists.
- `activeContext.md`: Current focus and recent decisions.
- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns.
- `techContext.md`: Tech stack and constraints.

## UI Quality Standards
- **Responsive**: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1440px).
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigable, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.
- **Performance**: Animations between 150-300ms.
- **Verification**: Use the browser tool for every front-end change.
