# Premium UI Logic

Apply these principles to elevate basic components to "Premium" status.

- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-blur` with subtle transparency and white/gray palettes.
- **Micro-interactions**: Implement subtle transitions for hovers and state changes.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use strong shadows for depth and professional navy/dark backgrounds for contrast.
- **Typography**: Focus on refined spacing and consistent font scales.
- **Performance**: Ensure all visual effects are performant and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
